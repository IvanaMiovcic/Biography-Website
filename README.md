# Biography-Website
A website I created for Free Code Camp's Tribute Page project. The purpose of this project was to create a tribute page for a famous person using HTML and CSS and have the site pass FreeCodeCamp's automated tests. Emphasis was placed on formatting HTML lists and proper use of CSS flexbox.

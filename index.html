          <h3> Margaret Hamilton was the chief programmer of the on-board software
              that landed the Apollo 11 misson on the moon. She was one of the first
              female programmers and her code built the foundation of
              software engineering.

            <h4> A Timeline of Her Life: </h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong> 1936: </strong> Margaret Elaine Heafield was born on August 17,
                  1936 in Paoli, Indiana, to parents Kenneth Heafield and
                  Ruth Esther Heafield. She has two younger siblings named David
                  and Kathryn.  </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1952: </strong> The family moved to Michigan, where Margaret attended
                  Hancock High School. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong>1955:</strong> After graduating high school, she studied mathematics at the University of Michigan
                  before transfering to Earlham College. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1958: </strong>While studying at Earlham, she met her husband James
                  Cox Hamilton. The couple got married on June 15, 1958, right after
                  she graduated from Earlham with a BA in mathematics and a minor
                  in philosophy. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1959:</strong> Margaret started working under Edward Norton Lorenz at
                  the Meteorology department at MIT. She was tasked with developing
                  software that predicts weather paterns. She gave birth to her
                  daughter, Lauren, on November 10 of the same year. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1961:</strong> For the next two years, she worked on the
                  Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) Project at the MIT Lincon Lab.
                  The software was a prototype for an enemy aircraft detection
                  system which would later be used by the U.S. Air Force. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1963:</strong> Hamilton joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at
                  MIT, which worked on the Apollo Space Missions. She was initially
                  hired as a programmer, but was soon moved to systems designs.</li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1964: </strong>She was promoted to leading the team tasked with
                  creating the Comand Module software for the Apollo 11 mission.
                  The software was responsible for navigation and lunar landing
                  commands. Margaret and her team created the software needed for
                  space flight with nothing to reference. She made unprecedented
                  advances in software engineering due to her ingenuity. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1967: </strong>Margaret files for divorce from her husband James. </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong> 1969: </strong>Her years of diligent work the command module finally
                  paid off when the Apollo 11 mission touched down on the moon.
                  Her flight software worked flawlessly during the landing. In
                  the same year, she marries her current husband Dan Lickly.</li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1973: </strong>Her code was used in Skylab space missions, which
                  launched a series of satellites into orbit. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1976: </strong>Hamilton co-founds a company called Higher Order Software
                  (HOS) in Cambridge, Massachusets. Using her knowledge from NASA,
                  her company developed software aimed at reducing user error. Her
                  company's software was implemented in many government programs. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 1986: </strong>After leaving Higher Order Software in 1985, she founded
                  her own company, aptly named Hamilton Technologies Inc. The company
                  revolved around Universal Systems Language (USL), a system modeling
                  language developed by Hamilton during her time at NASA. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 2016: </strong>She is awarded the Presedential Medal of Freedom from
                  President Barak Obama for her work in leading the development of
                  software for the Apollo 11 space mission. </li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 2017:</strong> She is one of four women to be featured in LEGO's "Women of NASA"
                  set, alongside NASA astronauts Mae Jemison, and Sally Ride, as well
                  as astronomer Nancy Grace Roman.</li>
                  <br>
                <li><strong> 2019:</strong> Google paid tribute to her accomplishments 50 years after
                  the Apollo 11 mission. They confirgured mirrors at their Ivanpah plant
                  to create a picture of Hamilton using moonlight. </li>
